DATA ENGINEERING TASK
Scenario:
Because voting is voluntary in the United States, the level of voter participation (referred to as "voter turnout") has a significant impact on the election results and resulting public policy.

Modeling voter turnout, and understanding where low turnout is prevalent, can inform outreach efforts to increase voter participation. With the ultimate goal of predicting voter turnout, in this exercise, you will focus on performing various data engineering tasks to prepare election result data for predictive analysis.

The data for this section is obtained from the Harvard DataverseOpens in new window and the United States Census BureauOpens in new window. The voter turnout dataset from Harvard Dataverse has vote totals from each U.S. county for U.S. presidential elections from 2000 to 2020.

DATA VISUALISATION TECHNIQUES
Scenario:
Because voting is voluntary in the United States, the level of voter participation (referred to as "voter turnout") has a significant impact on the election results and resulting public policy.

Modeling voter turnout, and understanding where low turnout is prevalent, can inform outreach efforts to increase voter participation. In this exercise, you will use various visualization techniques to explore relationships and patterns of voter turnout and to identify potential variables to use in your predictive analysis.

This part was done completely using ARCGIS Pro Software and its in-built tools.
